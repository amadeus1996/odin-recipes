        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Falafel is a popular Middle Eastern "fast food" made of a mixture of chickpeas (or fava beans), fresh herbs, and spices that are formed into a small patties or balls.  Itâ€™s thought that falafel originated in Egypt as Coptic Christians looked for a hearty replacement for meat during long seasons of fasting or lent.  It has also become a popular vegan food in Egypt and throughout the Middle East.</p>
        <p>This vegan dish is made with simple, everyday ingredients and you won't believe how easy it is. Great ingredients are key to great falafel so be sure to purchase high quality spices like cumin and coriander for your falafel mixture.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dried chickpeas: </strong>Avoid using canned chickpeas! Dried chickpeas (that have been soaked in water for 24 hours) are an important ingredient that will give your falafel the right consistency and taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh herbs: </strong>fresh parsley, cilantro, and dill are key to this authentic recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion: </strong>I typically use yellow onions, but white or red onions would work.</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic: </strong>for best flavor, use fresh garlic cloves.</li>
            <li><strong>Kosher salt and pepper: </strong>to taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices: </strong>cumin, coriander, and a little cayenne pepper. Along with the fresh herbs, this trio of spices is what gives falafel it's bold authentic taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder: </strong>this is what gives falafel an airy, fluffy texture (many recipes skip this, causing the falafel to come out too dense.)</li>
            <li><strong>Sesame seeds: </strong>these are optional here, but I do like the added nuttiness.</li>

        </ul>
